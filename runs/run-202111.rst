Pointing model run 2021/11
##########################

For this run we took data at higher elevation where the previous pointing model datasets were lacking.
Alone, this dataset is not enough to constrain a good pointing model so the idea was to combine it with data taken on :ref:`Pointing-model-run-202109`.

.. _Pointing-model-run-202111-Observations:

Observations
============

The data for this run was taken following a similar procedure to that of :ref:`Pointing-model-run-202106-Observations`.

A summary of the observations is shown in :ref:`table-observations-journal-202111`.

-------------------------

As mentioned before, this dataset consist mostly of observations taken at higher elevation to complement previous observations done with a lower maximum elevation limit. 

In order the derive a pointing model we then combined these observations with those taken on :ref:`Pointing-model-run-202109`.
These are the only dataset taken with the same set of LUTs for the hexapod and therefore, the only ones we can actually combine.

Fitting a simple 7-parameter pointing model to the data yields;

As with the other cases we still obtained some small correlated errors on some of the diagnostics plots.
A higher order pointing model is cabable or considerbaly reducing these errors and produces a small improvement on sky RMS.

In this case, we obtain the following model:

.. code-block: text

        coeff          value    sigma

    1     IA         -285.85    2.643

    15     TF         -104.01    7.508
    16     TX10        +28.07    3.276

    Sky RMS =   3.52
    Popn SD =   3.88

And the diagnostics plots for this case is shown in :numref:`fig-tpoint_a9plot_fauto_202111_tw004`.

Nevertheless, we still advise on using the simpler model above as the higher order model will likely suffer from overfitting.
